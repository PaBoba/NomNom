# Project 01 - NomNom Nav Resturant Picker

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to easily find nearby restaurants based on my location and preferences. I want to be able to filter results by cuisine type, price range, rating, opening hours, and parking availability. I also want to be able to see reviews and ratings from other users to help me make a decision about where to eat. The app should be easy to navigate and provide a clean user interface. Additionally, I would like to be able to save my favorite restaurants and view them later. When the restaurant has been picked I will be able to open the location with Google maps.

## Instructions
